# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

To build this upcoming app, I used HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as Node, Express to practice the back-end skills. Overall this project helped me develop these full-stack skills as well develop my brain to think more like a developer.
